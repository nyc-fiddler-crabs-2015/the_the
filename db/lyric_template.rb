Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity<br>
To seize everything you ever wanted. one moment<br>
Would you capture it or just let it slip?<br>
Yo<br>
<br>
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy<br>
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti<br>
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs,<br>
But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down,<br>
The whole crowd goes so loud<br>
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out<br>
He's choking how, everybody's joking now<br>
The clock's run out, time's up, over, bloah!<br>
Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity<br>
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked<br>
He's so mad, but he won't give up that<br>
Easy, no<br>
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes<br>
It don't matter, he's dope<br>
He knows that but he's broke<br>
He's so stagnant, he knows<br>
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's<br>
Back to the lab again, yo<br>
This whole rhapsody<br>
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him<br>
<br>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br>
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment<br>
You own it, you better never let it go<br>
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo<br>
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment<br>
You own it, you better never let it go<br>
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo<br>
(You better)<br>
<br>
The soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping<br>
This world is mine for the taking<br>
Make me king, as we move toward a new world order<br>
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post mortem<br>
It only grows harder, homie grows hotter<br>
He blows. It's all over. These hoes is all on him<br>
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter<br>
Lonely roads, God only knows<br>
He's grown farther from home, he's no father<br>
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter<br>
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water<br>
His hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product<br>
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows<br>
He nose dove and sold nada<br>
So the soap opera is told and unfolds<br>
I suppose it's old partner but the beat goes on<br>
Da da dum da dum da da<br>
<br>
<i>[Hook]</i><br>
<br>
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage<br>
Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged<br>
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed<br>
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage<br>
But I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher<br>
Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper<br>
All the pain inside amplified by the fact<br>
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5<br>
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family<br>
Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers<br>
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life<br>
And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder<br>
Trying to feed and water my seed, plus<br>
Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a prima donna<br>
Baby mama drama's screaming on and<br>
Too much for me to wanna<br>
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony<br>
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail<br>
I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot<br>
Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not<br>
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go<br>
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot<br>
So here I go it's my shot.<br>
Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got<br>
<br>

You can do anything you set your mind to, man

@ice_text = "Yo, VIP, let's kick it!<br />
<br />
Ice Ice Baby, Ice Ice Baby<br />
<br />
All right stop, Collaborate and listen<br />
Ice is back with my brand new invention<br />
Something grabs a hold of me tightly<br />
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly<br />
Will it ever stop? Yo, I don't know<br />
Turn off the lights and I'll glow<br />
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal<br />
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle.<br />
<br />
Dance, go rush the speaker that booms<br />
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom<br />
Deadly, when I play a dope melody<br />
Anything less than the best is a felony<br />
Love it or leave it, you better gain way<br />
You better hit bull's eye, the kid don't play<br />
<br />
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it<br />
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it<br />
<br />
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla<br />
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla<br />
<br />
Now that the party is jumping<br />
With the bass kicked in, and the Vegas are pumpin'<br />
Quick to the point, to the point, no faking<br />
Cooking MCs like a pound of bacon<br />
Burning them they ain't quick and nimble<br />
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal<br />
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo<br />
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo<br />
Rollin' in my 5.0<br />
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow<br />
The girlies on standby, waving just to say, 'Hi!'<br />
Did you stop? No, I just drove by<br />
Kept on pursuing to the next stop<br />
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block<br />
That block was dead Yo<br />
So I continued to A1A Beachfront Ave.<br />
<br />
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis<br />
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis<br />
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine<br />
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine<br />
Ready for the chumps on the wall<br />
The chumps acting ill because they're so full of 'Eight Ball'<br />
Gunshots ranged out like a bell<br />
I grabbed my nine, all I heard was shells<br />
Falling on the concrete real fast<br />
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas<br />
Bumper to bumper, the avenue's packed<br />
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack<br />
Police on the scene, you know what I mean<br />
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends<br />
<br />
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it<br />
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it<br />
<br />
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla<br />
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla<br />
<br />
Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet<br />
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it<br />
My town, that created all the bass sound<br />
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground<br />
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill<br />
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel<br />
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept<br />
We make it hype and you want to step with this<br />
Shay plays on the fade, slice like a ninja<br />
Cut like a razor blade so fast, other DJs say, 'Damn.'<br />
If my rhyme was a drug, I'd sell it by the gram<br />
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose<br />
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice<br />
<br />
If there was a problem, Yo, I'll solve it!<br />
Check out the hook while D-Shay revolves it.<br />
<br />
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla<br />
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla<br />
<br />
Yo, man, let's get out of here! Word to your mother!<br />
<br />
Ice Ice Baby Too cold, Ice Ice Baby Too cold Too cold<br />
Ice Ice Baby Too cold Too cold, Ice Ice Baby Too cold Too cold
